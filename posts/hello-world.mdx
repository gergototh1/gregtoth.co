# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using **MDX**. With MDX, I can write regular Markdown and also include React components directly in my content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can:

- Write normal Markdown content
- Include React components
- Create interactive content

## Example Code

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

I'll be writing more posts about:

1. **Web Development** - Tips and tricks
2. **React** - Best practices
3. **Next.js** - Advanced techniques
4. **TypeScript** - Type safety

Thanks for reading! ðŸš€
