# From Business Guy to Solo Developer

For over a decade, I lived in the world of business development and marketing. I was the guy who could close deals, understand market dynamics, and build relationships. But deep down, I always felt like I was one step removed from actually *building* the products I was selling.

## The Awakening

The turning point came when I started experimenting with AI development tools. What began as curiosity turned into late-night coding sessions. I realized that with the right tools and approach, I could build entire applications solo - something that would have required a team just a few years ago.

## The Learning Curve

The transition wasn't smooth. I had to:

- **Unlearn perfectionism**: Coming from business, I wanted everything to be polished. In development, especially solo development, good enough is often perfect.
- **Embrace rapid iteration**: Instead of months of planning, I learned to build, test, and iterate quickly.
- **Focus on user problems**: My business background actually helped here - I knew how to identify real problems worth solving.

## The AI Advantage

What made this transition possible was the emergence of AI-powered development tools. These tools allowed me to:

1. **Write code faster**: AI pair programming accelerated my learning and productivity
2. **Handle multiple technologies**: I could work across the full stack without being an expert in everything
3. **Focus on problem-solving**: Less time googling syntax, more time solving real problems

## Building Products Solo

Today, I can take an idea from concept to deployed product in weeks, not months. My approach combines:

- **Business intuition**: Understanding what users actually want
- **Technical pragmatism**: Using the right tools for the job, not the perfect tools
- **AI assistance**: Leveraging AI for everything from code generation to debugging

## The "Vibe Coding" Philosophy

I call my approach "vibe coding" - building with intuition, speed, and AI assistance. It's not about writing perfect code; it's about solving real problems quickly and effectively.

This philosophy has allowed me to build products like [Crypto Video Report](https://cryptovideoreport.com) and [Inbox2Invoice](https://inbox2invoice.com) - each addressing specific market needs I identified through my business experience.

## What's Next

The future of solo development is bright. As AI tools become more powerful and development processes become more streamlined, the barrier between having an idea and building a product continues to shrink.

For anyone considering a similar transition: start building. Don't wait until you're an expert. Use the tools available, leverage your existing skills, and focus on solving real problems. The rest will follow.
